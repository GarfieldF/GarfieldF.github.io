            The contestants were required to design and make a micro-grid simulation system consisting of two three-phase inverters and other loads within four days and three nights. The system frame diagram is shown in Figure 2. The load is a three-phase symmetrical resistance connected by Y-type. 
            <br>
            1.1 Basic Requirements
            <br>
            (1) Close S and provide three-phase symmetrical AC power to the load with inverter 1 only. When the load line current RMS value is 2A, the line voltage RMS value is 24V±0.2V and the frequency is 50Hz±0.2Hz.
            <br>
            (2) Under the working conditions of basic requirement (1), the total harmonic distortion rate (THD) of AC bus voltage is not more than 3%.
            <br>
            (3) Under the working conditions of basic requirement (1), the efficiency η of inverter 1 is not less than 87%.
            <br>
            (4) When inverter 1 supplies power to the load and the load line current RMS value varies between 0 and 2A, the load regulation rate is less than 0.3%.
            
            <!-- 1.2 Power generation part
            (1) Inverter 1 and Inverter 2 can jointly output power to the load, so that the load line current RMS value reaches 3A and the frequency is 50Hz±0.2Hz.
            (2) When the effective value of load line current varies between 1~3A, the output power of inverter 1 and inverter 2 is kept as 1:1 distribution, and the absolute value of the difference between the output line currents of the two inverters is not more than 0.1A. The load adjustment rate is ≤0.3%.
            (3) When the effective value of load line current varies between 1~3A, the output power of Inverter 1 and Inverter 2 can be automatically distributed within the specified range (ratio K is 1:2~2:1) according to the setting, and the absolute value of the difference between the two inverter output line current conversion values is not more than 0.1A. -->
